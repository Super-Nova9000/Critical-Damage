This is a platformer game I'm making for my Computer Science A-Level coursework.

The movement in this game is similar to Mario, as I like that system the best out of the games I tested.

--Lore--

I have nowhere to write my lore for this game, so I'll write it here:

The year is 2100, and your colony ship has crashed. You used to be the chief engineer, but after a rapid promotion, bought about by you being the sole survivor of the crash, you are now the captain of the United Earth Alliance (UEA) Welcome Wagon. After you wrap up your promotion party early (it's a bit lonely without anyone else), you decide you need to repair the ship and get back home.

This is easier said than done.

Your ship is absoloutely wrecked, again due to the aforementioned crash, and the atmosphere outside is far from proper for human survival. The ship had some solar panels in it's cargo hold, although some had to be discarded due to damage, so they have been setup outside to provide power to the ship's essential systems during the day, and charge the batteries for heating in preparation for night. After a few days, you manage to repair the droid control station. This allows you to control the repair droids for the ship, meaning you can kick back and relax, letting the drones do all the work instead of you! On your first day, you make them do an assessment of the damage to the ship:

-HULL INTEGRITY - COMPROMISED

-ELECTRICAL SYSTEM - PARTIAL OUTAGE

-LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS - PARTIAL OUTAGE

----OXYGEN - OPERATIONAL
	
----HEATING - OPERATIONAL

----AIR PRESSURE - DEGRADED
	
----CO2 SCRUBBING - FAILURE

----WATER RECYCLING - PARTIAL OUTAGE

----FOOD SYTHENSISER - REDUCED OPERATION

-ENGINES - FAILURE

-FUEL - 5%

You get the idea...

Since the Welcome Wagon was rendered unflyable due to the damage, you now have to make your own rescue craft.
